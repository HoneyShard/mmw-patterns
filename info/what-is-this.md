If youâ€™re looking for an **introduction to charting**, check out this guide instead:\

Please don't be scared to [contribute](https://mmwpatterns.gitbook.io/mmwpatterns/info/how-can-i-contribute)! It's okay if your additions are a little messy.

### Browse Patterns

* [Gimmicky Patterns](https://mmwpatterns.gitbook.io/mmwpatterns/gimmicks/)
* [Calmer Patterns](https://mmwpatterns.gitbook.io/mmwpatterns/basic/)
* Mixed or unusual patterns can be added as needed.

The naming schemes aren't very strict, but they should give you a tiny bit of a nudge in the right direction if you're looking for something specific.
