# Info

Traces are very unique as in they can be used in basically every scenario.

e.g:

<details>

<summary>As Decoration</summary>

As seen in: Marble Blue Master

Trace background is used to make the hold golden.

<summary>As a flick</summary>

While not actually considered a flick, it can be hit in the same way.
